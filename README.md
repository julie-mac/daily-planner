# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project was to create a daily planner to be able to create a daily schedule. The page displays today's date, as well as time blocks for a 9-5 work day. You can input any to-dos in the given time blocks and save them, and they will remain there as you refresh the page. The time blocks will display as different colours if they are in the past, present or future. Past hours will display grey, the current hour will display red, and future hours will display green.
